# ECE_387_Midterm

This project will be a part of a group project with John Kessinger, Jon Schaff, and Mark Sullivan to create the popular game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"

My portion of the project is to use the arduino microcontroller to produce various words via a speaker in morse code which are then to be decoded by a manual by entering a passcode into a keypad. Each word will have a single unique passcode and the word that comes out is pseudo-random. Also as a part of the project is to integrate the parts of the game to a time and strike counter. In this project I will inteface the keypad and speaker with the aruino as well as work with memory management and other levels of the project once it comes together as a group.
