# ECE_387_Midterm

This project will be a part of a group project with John Kessinger, Jon Schaff, and Mark Sullivan to create the popular game "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"

For my midterm chip interface I would like to work with controlling an LEDs and speaker using an H-Bridge. The specific module I plan to use is the L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller. I wanted to potentially use this chip in the final project as a way to drive an LEDs to represent the morse code. I would also need to build supplimental cicuitry to ensure that the current on either side of the bridge doesn't get too high.

My portion of the final project is to use the arduino microcontroller to produce various words in morse code with LEDs which are then to be decoded by a manual by entering a passcode into a keypad. Each word will have a single unique passcode and the word that comes out is pseudo-random.
